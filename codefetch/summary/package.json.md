This is the main configuration file for the Flex Chatbot VS Code extension. It defines the extension's metadata, such as its name, version, author, and repository. It also specifies the activation events, the main entry point (`./out/extension.js`), and the contributions the extension makes to VS Code, including custom views, commands, menus, and configuration settings. The `scripts` section defines various development and build commands, and the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections list the external libraries used by the extension.
