This file specifies files and folders that should be ignored by VS Code when packaging the extension. It excludes development-specific files like the `.vscode` and `.vscode-test` folders, the `src` directory (as the compiled output from `out` is used), and other configuration and output files that are not needed in the final extension package. This helps to keep the extension size small and include only the necessary files for it to run.
