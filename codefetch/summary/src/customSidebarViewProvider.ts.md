This file is the core of the webview panel. It's responsible for creating and managing the webview, handling messages between the webview and the extension, and coordinating with other services like `ApiService`, `ConfigService`, and `ChatService`. It initializes the webview with the necessary HTML content, scripts, and styles, and it listens for and responds to user interactions within the webview, such as sending a message or selecting a model.
