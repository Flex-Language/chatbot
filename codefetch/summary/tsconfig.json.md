This file configures the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) for the project. It specifies that the code should be compiled to CommonJS modules targeting the ES2020 JavaScript version. The compiled output is placed in the `out` directory, and source maps are generated for debugging. The `include` and `exclude` properties define which files should be included in the compilation process, ensuring that only the source code in the `src` directory is compiled and that `node_modules`, test files, and the output directory are ignored.
